>*<sub>This site is dedicated to HW311, a computer lab in Haking Wong Building HKU, and
my companions there. In my four years of university, I spent most of the time
learning, coding, and living in HW311. In there I've also met many friends and
mentors, who guided me through my ups and downs. I dare not except that I have
left my own impression on HW311 or the great minds there, but the wisdom of
them has always been enlightening me.</sub>*

Graduated from HKU (BEng CompSci) and UCI (MSCS). Working as an SDE in the Bay
Area.

Inspired and encouraged by my friends, I hereby boldly open up a space to write
and record.

I enjoy trying out new things but my perseverance may be questionable.
