This site is dedicated to HW311, a computer lab in Haking Wong Building HKU, and
my companions there. In my four years of university, I spent most of the time
learning, coding, and living in HW311. In there I've also met many friends and
mentors, who guided me through my ups and downs. I dare not except that I have
left my own impression upon HW311 or the great minds there, but the wisdom of
them has always been enlightening me.

It was my honour.
